# Unofficial-pfSense-packages
Unofficial packages for pfSense software

As many people know already, Netgate has trimmed a lot of packages from official repo since pfSenseÂ® 2.3. 

This repo updates some packages for newer pfSense software versions with manual procedure installs.

This is not supported by Netgate or pfSense team. Use it at your own risk.

Feedbacks and contributions are always welcome.
